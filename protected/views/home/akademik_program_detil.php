                    <p>Research lies at the heart of the graduate experience at Boston College. Graduate students work directly with faculty in their labs while continuing their education. Current areas of faculty scholarship and expertise include Cell and Developmental Biology, Microbiology and Infectious Disease, and Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Within these areas of study the department offers a program of study leading to a Ph.D. For more information about faculty research visit the Research page. The Biology department also offers state-of-the-art research laboratories and core-research support facilities, including confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and FACS facilities.
